# Weather App (python3)

### Description
This is yet another simple app for calling RapidAPI WeatherAPI.com endpoints. This is a common
tool I use to learn more about other langauges, and I highly recommend checking out RapidAPI and
all of their offerings.

The two main endpoints here are Current Weather and Astronomy. In the future there may be other
endpoints added to this but for now these are the two pieces of information I value the most. There
should (read: this is being written before code work has begun) also be a transform service to take both
API calls, remove unnecessary information, and return one combined JSON string.
